Compose a function named *factorial* whose definition is as follows:

    Given a starting number called n: *factorial* calculates the product of multiplying a series of descending natural numbers, starting from n and ending with 0. In mathematics, this is written with the notation n!). For examples, refer to www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/factorial.html

    when n is 0, return 1
    otherwise, return n times the factorial of (n-1)

Test: print the factorial of (4); assert that factorial of (4) is 24
